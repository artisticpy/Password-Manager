# Password-Manager
This program is made with Python and MySQL 

INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The objective of this project isto create an effective Password Manager. This project has a variety
of functions, these are:
• Store and manage their passwords for different services 
• Organize passwords into categories for easy retrieval
• Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for added security
• Generate strong and unique username/passwords
• Security
➢ RSA Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using RSA encryption, providing robust 
security for user data.
➢ Master Password: Users must enter a master password to access the application, adding 
an extra layer of security.
➢ Also user can check the strength of the password
This project uses MySQL-Connector for Python. It is a tool that can be used to access, modify
and create databases in MySQL from Python. While adding records, we can specify details
such as the service name, username, password, email as well as remarks. We can also view all 
records directly in the database, but passwords are not visible for privacy. While opening the,
Password Manager we must enter the correct Master password so as to connect to the MySQL
server, it also plays a dual-role by also helping to avoid unauthenticated access. After 
authentication, we are greeted by the main page, wherewe can proceed with the functions we 
want to perform.

IN DETAIL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In an increasingly digital world where security breaches and data leaks have become all too common, the need for robust and reliable password management solutions has never been more evident. As individuals and organizations like grapple with the challenge of maintaining numerous online accounts, each requiring unique and complex passwords, the demand for a streamlined and secure method of password organization has grown exponentially. The Password Manager aims to address this pressing need by developing a comprehensive and userfriendly password management system. This system will provide users with a centralized platform to store, generate, and manage their passwords, enhancing both security and convenience. By incorporating state-of-the-art encryption techniques and advanced security protocols, it aims to mitigate the vulnerabilities associated with traditional password storage methods, such as written notes or easily forgettable passwords. 

This project will cater to a wide range of users, from individuals seeking to safeguard their personal online accounts to businesses aiming to fortify their cybersecurity infrastructure. Password Manager CS is designed to strike a balance between usability and security, ensuring that users can easily access their passwords when needed while maintaining the highest standards of data protection. Throughout this project, we will delve into the intricacies of password management, encryption algorithms, user authentication mechanisms, and intuitive user interface design. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies 
and best practices, Password Manager will provide a versatile solution that can adapt to various platforms and devices, including desktop computers, smartphones, and tablets. As we embark on the journey of developing Password Manager, we are committed to delivering a tool that not only meets the immediate password management needs of our users but also lays the foundation for a more secure digital future. Through continuous refinement, rigorous testing, and close collaboration with cybersecurity experts, our goal is to create a password management solution that instills confidence in its users, allowing them to navigate the digital landscape with peace of mind.

Features
• Command-line interface (CLI) style 
• Easy to access ’help’ command

Generation 
• Choose length of password 
• Fine-tune the complexity of password 
• Ability to generate usernames to prevent giving out real information 

Managing Accounts 
• Add email, username and password 
• Ability to add 2-factor authentication ’secret’ key to prevent the need for an application like Google 

Authenticator
• Option to add ’notes’ like recovery codes 

Migration 
• Easily migrate to another computer by simply copying all files. 
• Instructions on how to do so securely will be included in the program. 

This password manager will solve all problems that people have with password managers. It solves the 
problem of short and weak passwords being used by generating long ones, it solves the problem of 
forgetting passwords by remembering them for you, and it also prevents the need of a mobile phone for 
2-factor authentication codes.
